# CppAbundantNumbers

## Overview
CppAbundantNumbers is a C++ program that identifies and lists all abundant numbers up to a user-specified limit. An abundant number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors exceeds the number itself.

## Compilation and Execution
To compile and run this program, you will need a C++ compiler. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/mht83/CppAbundantNumbers.git
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
cd CppAbundantNumbers
3. Compile the program using a C++ compiler like g++:
g++ -o AbundantNumbers main.cpp
4. Run the executable:
./AbundantNumbers

## How It Works
The program prompts the user to enter a positive integer. It then calculates the sum of proper divisors for each number up to the entered limit and prints out the numbers for which the sum of divisors is greater than the number itself, indicating that they are abundant.
